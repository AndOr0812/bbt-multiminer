## Bits Be Trippin' & alon7 Multi-miner

Bits Be Trippin' is a youtube channel for cryptocurrencies mining. 
They created the initial multiminer to enable easy switch between miners.
I took the script a step further and added more pools, coins and options for easy mining.

## Setup

1. Right click on bbt-multiminer.bat -> edit 
2. Under "Wallets", according to the coin you want to mine, change the wallet address to yours
3. You can name your miner if you change the MINER_NAME variable
4. Change the EMAIL_ADDRESS to receieve updates from supported pools (nanopool for now)

## How to 

1. Go to Setup before starting
2. Double click the bbt-multiminer.bat
3. Chose the miner and the coin you want to mine from the options.
4. Profit.

## Contributors

If you want to add more miners, you are more than welcome to send a merge request. 
Notice that to add a binary for a miner, you would have to send us the link to the miner, instead of commiting it yourself.  
We want to be sure the miners are untouched and do not contain malware or trying to take over on people mining
